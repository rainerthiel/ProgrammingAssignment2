## Programming Assignment 2 - Lexical Scoping

`runTests()`

This function runs a few examples to test the matrix inversion and caching.

- There are 5 test cases, 3 are expected to work, 2 are expected to fail.
- An inner function handles the common stuff.
- A successful test returns the associated identity matrix.
- A test failure reports the error and continues onto the next test.

Note: I have had to round the identity matrix values (8 significant digits)
